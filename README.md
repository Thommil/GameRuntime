# GameRuntime
Runtime and framework for LibGDX specific scene type :
* Sprites using normal maps for 2.5D rendering
* Particles support using LiquidFun (based on custom LibGDX extension in my repos)
* Separated loops for rendering and physics for heavy computation of actors
* Stream loading of scene components
